    <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
       </p>
      <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
<p><h3>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</h3></p>
<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
     <h2> Example Explained</h2>
<p>The !DOCTYPE html with < > declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document</p>
<p>The html with < > element is the root element of an HTML page</p>
<p>The head with < > element contains meta information about the HTML page
</p>
<p>The title with < > element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)</p>
<p>The body with < > element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</p>
<p>The h1 with < > element defines a large heading</p>
<p>The p with < > element defines a paragraph</p>

    <h1 style="color:red">Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
     <p>
       Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
     </p>
     <p>A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document.
A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block.</p>
<p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
For Example:
-> color is property and blue is value.
-> font size is property and 12px is value.

A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
<p>Teaches you all of the basics of HTML and CSS needed to design a website.
You will get to practice your knowledge alongside.
You will get a project of your own by the end of this course.
Teaches you everything from the scratch, so even if you do not have any prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, it is completely fine.
This course also has section wise quizzes which will help you to test your knowledge so far.
This course is completely free of cost.
Prerequisites: There isn’t any prior knowledge needed to join this course. We will be covering everything from the scratch so even if you do not have any knowledge of web development then this is the perfect course to begin with.Development Environment: There isn’t any specific IDE needed to learn and practice this course. You just need a text-editor to type your code and a Web Browser to render it. However, we recommend using the Sublime Text Editor and Google Chrome Web Browser.

Course Guidelines: Here are some guidelines to efficiently use the course.

Don’t hurry up: We recommend you to not hurry up and finish up the entire course in just one day by taking the course for long hours.
Practice Along Side: Repeatedly practice the course along side by typing the codes in your own code editor and render it in your browser.
Do not Copy Paste: Avoid directly copying and pasting the codes from our source to your editor. Instead, first try to understand the codes and type that code on your own. If you make a mistake and get a different output then comeback and match your code to ours to find out where you went wrong.
Do not Skip any section: Please do not skip any section by just reading the title.
Do not skip the Practice Quiz: Please do not skip the section wise quizzes in the hurry to learn the next section. The quizzes are specially designed to test your knowledge of a section you just completed.</p>
     <p style="font-size:x-large" "font-color:red";>WHY CSS?</p>

<p><b>CSS saves time :</b> You can write CSS once and reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages.</p>
<p><b>Easy Maintainence :</b> To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.</p>
<p><b>Search Engines :</b> CSS is considered as clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.</p>
<p><b>Offline Browsing :</b> CSS can store web applications locally with the help of offline catche.Using of this we can view offline websites.</p>
<p>The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.
In the example below, all HTML elements with class=”center” will be red and center-aligned:</p>

    <h1 style="background-color:red">JAVA SCRIPT</h1>
    <p style="font-family: bold">What is JavaScript?</p>
    
<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
<p>* Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
<p>* Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>
